# WordPress-Website-Development

https://julesmechanicalservices.co.uk

I designed this website and developed it using mainly WordPress Content Manager System and different plugins for security, spam, image resizing, SEO and easy maintenance. 

With a clear and straightforward design, the website displays key information about the company, services provided, a gallery showing previous works and 2 contact forms - one for careers and one for general enquiries. The home page implements a carousel display, with links directing to the relevant information within the page or different pages.
